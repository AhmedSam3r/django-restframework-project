# Django REST Framework Tutorial Project

This project is part of a comprehensive tutorial series on building APIs with Django Rest Framework (DRF). It demonstrates various features of DRF, from basic API views to more advanced topics like JWT authentication, search functionality, and integrating external services like Algolia for search indexing.

## Project Features

This project covers a wide range of features and tools, such as:

- **Django Rest Framework Basics**: Learn how to create API views, handle GET/POST requests, and serialize Django models into JSON.
- **Token Authentication**: Implement token-based authentication using the `simplejwt` package.
- **Session Authentication**: Configure session-based authentication for the API.
- **Custom Permissions**: Create custom permission classes to control access to certain endpoints.
- **Pagination**: Add pagination to your API to efficiently handle large data sets.
- **JWT Authentication**: Implement JSON Web Token authentication for secure API access.
- **Search with Algolia**: Integrate Algolia to add powerful search capabilities to your API and client.
- **JavaScript Client**: Interact with the API through a JavaScript frontend.
- **Python Client**: A set of Python scripts for interacting with the API programmatically.
- **CORS Handling**: Configure CORS to allow frontend clients (JavaScript) to access the API from different origins.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Django 4.x
- Django Rest Framework
- Virtualenv

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/Django-Rest-Framework-Tutorial.git
   cd Django-Rest-Framework-Tutorial
   ```

2. **Create and activate the virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Django development server:**

   ```bash
   cd backend/cfehome
   python manage.py migrate  # Apply database migrations
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

5. **Access the project:**

   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Running API Tests

This project includes Python and JavaScript clients that can interact with the API. Here’s how to test the API:

### Python Client

Located in the `pyclient` directory, you can run various Python scripts to interact with the API.

Example to list all products:

```bash
python pyclient/list.py
```

Example to create a new product:

```bash
python pyclient/create.py
```

### JavaScript Client

You can also use the `js_client` to interact with the API through a web interface.

1. Open `js_client/index.html` in your browser.
2. Modify `client.js` to make API requests using JWT tokens for authentication.
